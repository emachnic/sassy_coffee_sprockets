# SASSy, Coffee-Flavored Sprockets

This is a presentation for the North Florida Ruby Brigade for the May
16th, 2011 meetup. I go over some of the changes in Rails 3.1. It is in
Keynote and Powerpoint formats. Feel free to clone the repository and check
out the slides.

I will try and post video of the talk shortly after the meetup.
